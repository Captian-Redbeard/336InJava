Hello, here is my log.

PROBLEM: For some reason the file writing is incomplete. The last 28 pixels are not written to
the file.

RANDOM: My code ends at "Scans remaining: 176". I don't know if this is related to the other
problem of ending prematurely but maybe.

TODO: What the heck does the scatter Ray do in materials? IDK
